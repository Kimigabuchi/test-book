To access the forum, go to <a href="https://forums.manning.com/forums/deep-learning-with-python">https://forums.manning.com/forums/deep-learning-with-python</a>.

  <p class="noind">Manning’s commitment to our readers is to provide a venue where a meaningful dialogue between individual readers and between readers and the author can take place. It isn’t a commitment to any specific amount of participation on the part of the author, whose contribution to the forum remains voluntary (and unpaid). We suggest you try asking him some challenging questions lest his interest stray! The forum and the archives of previous discussions will be accessible from the publisher’s website as long as the book is in print.</p>
