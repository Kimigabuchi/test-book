  <h1 class="part" id="pref02"><a class="calibre3" id="pref02__title"></a>Acknowledgments</h1>

  <p class="noind">I’d like to thank the Keras community for making this book possible. Keras has grown to have hundreds of open source contributors and more than 200,000 users. Your contributions and feedback have turned Keras into what it is today.</p>

  <p class="noind">I’d also like to thank Google for backing the Keras project. It has been fantastic to see Keras adopted as TensorFlow’s high-level API. A smooth integration between Keras and TensorFlow greatly benefits both TensorFlow users and Keras users and makes deep learning accessible to most.</p>

  <p class="noind">I want to thank the people at Manning who made this book possible: publisher Marjan Bace and everyone on the editorial and production teams, including Christina Taylor, Janet Vail, Tiffany Taylor, Katie Tennant, Dottie Marsico, and many others who worked behind the scenes.</p>

  <p class="noind">Many thanks go to the technical peer reviewers led by Aleksandar Dragosavljević—Diego Acuña Rozas, Geoff Barto, David Blumenthal-Barby, Abel Brown, Clark Dorman, Clark Gaylord, Thomas Heiman, Wilson Mar, Sumit Pal, Vladimir Pasman, Gustavo Patino, Peter Rabinovitch, Alvin Raj, Claudio Rodriguez, Srdjan Santic, Richard Tobias, Martin Verzilli, William E. Wheeler, and Daniel Williams—and the forum contributors. Their contributions included catching technical mistakes, errors in terminology, and typos, and making topic suggestions. Each pass through the review process and each piece of feedback implemented through the forum topics shaped and molded the manuscript.</p>

  <p class="noind">On the technical side, special thanks go to Jerry Gaines, who served as the book’s technical editor; and Alex Ott and Richard Tobias, who served as the book’s technical proofreaders. They’re the best technical editors I could have hoped for.</p>

  <p class="noind">Finally, I’d like to express my gratitude to my wife Maria for being extremely supportive throughout the development of Keras and the writing of this book.</p>
